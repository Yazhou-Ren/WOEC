This package contains a MATLAB implementation of the WOEC algorithms
as described in
Yazhou Ren, Carlotta Domeniconi, Guoji Zhang and Guoxian Yu, "Weighted-
Object Ensemble Clustering", in Proceedings of the IEEE 13th International
Conference on Data Mining, Dallas, Texas, December 7-10, 2013, pp.627-636. 

Yazhou Ren, Carlotta Domeniconi, Guoji Zhang, Guoxian Yu. Weighted-object ensemble clustering: methods and analysis. Knowledge and Information Systems, 2017, 51(2), pp.661-689.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use it copy all files in WOEC folder to a directory in your MATLAB 
path or the current directory in your MATLAB environment. Need to add all 
subfolders of WOEC to path of MATLAB. Demo_WOEC.m gives an example of 
how to apply WOEC into a real clustering task.
It has been tested on WIN8 Matlab R2010a.
