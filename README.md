# WOEC

Weighted-Object Ensemble CLustering (WOEC) 

This package contains a MATLAB implementation of the WOEC algorithms
as described in
1) Yazhou Ren, Carlotta Domeniconi, Guoji Zhang and Guoxian Yu, "Weighted-Object Ensemble Clustering", in Proceedings of the IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining, Dallas, Texas, December 7-10, 2013, pp.627-636. 

2) Yazhou Ren, Carlotta Domeniconi, Guoji Zhang, Guoxian Yu. Weighted-object ensemble clustering: methods and analysis. Knowledge and Information Systems, 2017, 51(2), pp.661-689.

To use it copy all files in WOEC folder to a directory in your MATLAB path or the current directory in your MATLAB environment. Need to add all subfolders of WOEC to path of MATLAB. Demo_WOEC.m gives an example of how to apply WOEC into a real clustering task. It has been tested on WIN8 Matlab R2010a.
